This repository contains multiple PIC microcontroller projects designed and simulated in Proteus.

It includes practical examples such as LED blinking, switch interface, single and two-digit seven-segment display, DC motor control, 4-bit LCD interface, ADC, 4x4 Keypad, Timers, Interrupts, PWM and UART.

Each project folder provides the Proteus simulation file (.pdsprj). To run any project, simply open the respective file in Proteus and start the simulation.

These projects serve as a comprehensive reference for students and beginners to understand and practice fundamental PIC microcontroller applications using Proteus.
